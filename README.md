# BUS RESERVATION SYSTEM
<br>


## Project Logo:
<br>
*The Bus Reservation System is a console-based project that introduces two pivotal roles: ADMIN and USER. In the role of an ADMIN, I have the capability to add buses, oversee bus management, create new routes, and remove buses as necessary. As a USER, I empower passengers to book buses, cancel reservations, manage their wallets, and access a comprehensive overview of their booking history. Together, these roles synergize to provide a reliable and efficient bus reservation experience for all users.*
